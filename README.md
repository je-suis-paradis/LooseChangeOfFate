Back with another one of those block-rockin' Console Apps. 
This was the first mandatory lab, and I failed to turn it in due time (sorry, @kakashidota).
That won't happen again if I can help it. 

It's a text-based lo-fi faux-rpg adventure for the console. While the game itself won't make 
the GOTY short-list, I am beyond proud of what I was able to produce. perform. I underestimated 
how much time it takes to be thorough and calibrate the "finer details", and I may have taken 
the assignment a tad too seriously. But I had a blast doing it.

So, what you get is a showcase of approximately four weeks of grinding C#, trying too hard, and not
"getting it" until that one day when you've almost decided that you're ready to hang up those gloves.

Loose Change of Fate is my first ever game, I mean "game". It's got too many classes and folders 
(thx C Gippety for that â€” I owe you one) but pulling my hair out, and trying to convey these
vague ideas to an LLM put me in a spot where I could just grind and search for errors in the "finer-
details" descriptions in VS, asking Chippity-Gippity to simplify their description of the concepts I'm still
not best friends with. And slowly but surely, I sense that one day, I will master this language.
